## 🔍 Overview

While recent video world models excel at simulating static environments, they share a critical blind spot: the physical world is dynamic. When moving subjects exit the camera's field of view and later re-emerge, current models often lose track of them—rendering returning subjects as frozen statues, distorted phantoms, or letting them vanish entirely.

To bridge this gap, we introduce **Hybrid Memory**, a novel paradigm that requires models to simultaneously act as precise archivists for static backgrounds and vigilant trackers for dynamic subjects. A true world model must not only remember a subject's appearance but also mentally predict its unseen trajectory, ensuring visual and motion continuity even during out-of-view intervals.

  <summary>Abstract
  </summary>

Video world models have shown immense potential in simulating the physical world, yet existing memory mechanisms primarily treat environments as static canvases. When dynamic subjects hide out of sight and later re-emerge, current methods often struggle, leading to frozen, distorted, or vanishing subjects. We introduce **Hybrid Memory**, a novel paradigm requiring models to simultaneously act as precise archivists for static backgrounds and vigilant trackers for dynamic subjects, ensuring motion continuity during out-of-view intervals. To facilitate research in this direction, we construct **HM-World**, the first large-scale video dataset dedicated to hybrid memory. It features 59K high-fidelity clips with decoupled camera and subject trajectories, encompassing 17 diverse scenes, 49 distinct subjects, and meticulously designed exit-entry events to rigorously evaluate hybrid coherence. Furthermore, we propose **HyDRA**, a specialized memory architecture that compresses contexts into memory tokens and utilizes a spatiotemporal relevance-driven retrieval mechanism. By selectively attending to relevant motion cues, HyDRA effectively preserves the identity and motion of hidden subjects. Extensive experiments on HM-World demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both dynamic subject consistency and overall generation quality.

## 📅 TODO
* [ ] Release the paper
* [ ] Release HM-World dataset
* [ ] Release HyDRA checkpoints and inference code
* [ ] Release HyDRA training code


## 🛠️ Installation

### Step 1: Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/H-EmbodVis/VEGA-3D.git
cd HyDRA
```

> If your cloned folder name is not `HyDRA`, please `cd` into the actual folder.

### Step 2: Create & activate an Anaconda environment

```bash
conda create -n hydra python=3.10 -y
conda activate hydra
```

### Step 3: Install required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Download the pretrained Wan2.1 (1.3B) T2V model

- Model link: https://huggingface.co/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B
- Recommended location: `./ckpts`

Example directory structure (recommended):

```text
HyDRA/
└── ckpts/
    ├── Wan2.1_VAE.pth
    ├── diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors
    ├── models_t5_umt5-xxl-enc-bf16.pth
    └── ... (other files)
```

### Step 5: Download the trained HyDRA weights

- Checkpoint link:
- Recommended location: `./ckpts` (e.g., `./ckpts/hydra.pth`)


## 🚀 Inference

Run inference on the example data:

```bash
python infer_hydra.py
```
